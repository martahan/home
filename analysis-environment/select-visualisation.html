    <p> Finally, our selection sequence resulted in highlighting the instrumentation points that are
      relevant for the selected calls, binding, and subatom. These points are now also interactive -
      we need to choose one at which we want to analyse the results observed at runtime. The first example
      of this is plotting the observed duration of a call.

    <div class="slideshow-container">
      <div class="mySlides fade">
        <p> The example above is based on a simple formula that refers only to one point in the code.
          As the formula sets a constraint over the duration of calls of the function <i>find_new_hashes</i>,
          it is logical that we might want to see the observed durations of those calls. The plot below shows
          the observed durations of the mentioned function calls, but only those that occurred during the
          selected function calls of the monitored function <i>check_hashes</i>.

      <div class="mySlides fade">
        <p> The previous plot has shown us the measurements taken by VyPR. However, we want to see if those
          observations satisfied the constraint given in the formula. In this case, that means checking
          whether a recorded duration belongs to the interval between 0 and 0.3 seconds. The verdicts that
          say if the condition was met or violated are also stored by VyPR, but as boolean values. Apart
          from determining whether the observed value succeeded or failed to meet the constraint, it is also
          of interest to know by how much. <i>Verdict severity</i> is a quantity whose absolute value is based
          on the distance between the observed value and the border value between success and failure, assigned
          a positive sign if the observation is a success and a negative one if there was a failure.

    <h2> Another example: a more complex formula </h2>
    <p> The queries that set a constraint over the program run can be different than the one we have seen
      so far. Let's take a look at one that, instead of measuring the duration of a single function call,
      selects two points of interest in the code and observes the time that the program run takes between
      those points. The formula shown below selects a point at which the variable called
      <i>self.destination_tag_name</i> changes and a point at which function
      <i>self._conddbfw_con.session.commit</i> is called and states that the program run should take no
      more than 0.1 second to get from the first one to the other.
    </p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="../static/images/web_tool/other-function-1.png">

    <p> Since the query is about a pair of points, rather than just one, in order to analyse the performance,
      we need to fix a pair of points in the code at which observations were taken. There can be more such
      pairs, which is why they are grouped by bindings. In this example, there are two bindings and we can
      filter the points in the code by selecting the binding of interest.

        <p> Additionally, when we are creating plots we need to select a pair of points the time between
          which we want to observe. At runtime, the time when each one is reached is recorded, but we need
          to pair them and calculate the difference. This is all done in the background, while the user only
          needs to select the pair of points of interest. Choosing the first one is an option available in
          the dropdown menu.
